                     The dataset used, from the two available on the Kaggle Repository, was the "ks-project-201801.csv" because, as the title 
                suggests and as well as data exploration comes up, it concerns data from 2009 to 2017. The other one available, instead, contains 
                data from 2009 to 2016. Furthermore, this choice has also been made due to the presence of the columns "usd pledged real" and 
                "usd goal real" which meaning is explained below. The dataset contains information and details about the Kickstarter Projects. 
                Being more specific, each line is referred to a particular project and for each one of them there are a lot of information about the project 
                referred. Following a brief explanation of the attributes used for the analysis:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <i>name</i> of the Project;</li>
                  <li>The <i>main category</i>  in which the project is collocated;</li>
                  <li>The <i>category</i> that represent a sub-category in the wider main category;</li>
                  <li>The <i>launched</i> that represents the date in which the project was launched;</li>
                  <li>The <i>state</i> that denotes if the project has been successful (i.e. the case in which the money 
                    pledged were higher than the goal), failed (i.e. the case in which the money pledged were lower than the goal), cancelled, live, suspended and undefined.</li>
                  <li>The <i>backers</i> which represents the number of people that support this project;</li>
                  <li>The <i>usd_pledged_real</i> which is, considering that not all the projects use the same currency, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column;</li>
                  <li>The <i>usd_goal_real</i> which is, as the usd_pledged_real, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column.</li>
                </ul>
                To avoid the slowness of page loading, as consequence of the weight of the whole dataset, it has been filtered using a Jupyter 
                Python Notebook to delete the rows and the columns that have not been used in the specific visualisation. 
                The data-sets of filtered data and the code used to obtain them have been uploaded on <a href = "https://github.com/antoniolch/KickstarterProjectDetails">this</a href> Github Repository.</br>

                  Regarding the <i>Robot</i>, <i>3D Printing</i> and <i>Software</i> categories, how the number of projects launched 
                  vary across the years from 2014 to 2017? Is the pattern consistent between these three categories?

                  This line chart aims to show how the number of projects launched in the main category 
                  <i>Technology</i> vary during the period from 2014 to 2017, considering the <i>Robot</i>, <i>3D Printing</i> and <i>Software</i> sub-category.

                  Using this line chart, it is possible to see the trend during the years from 2014 to 2017 regarding respectively the <i>3D Printing</i>, 
                  the <i>Robots</i> and the <i>Software</i> categories. This graph shows that there was a great increase in the number of projects launched in the 2015 in each category. 
                  However, <i>Software</i> category has had a greater interesting then the other two, considering the number of projects launched in the whole period. 
                  Then, the pattern that comes up from this analysis is the general increase in the number of projects launched during 2015 followed by a slight decrease during the following years.

                  It has been used a line chart because it is the best way to spot and compare trends as which seen before. 
                  Colours have been also used to encode the different analysed categories. The colours choice is made according to the 
                  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/TableauColors/ColorPaletteswithRGBValues?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Adisplay_count=y&%3Adisplay_static_image=y">Colour Blind 10 palette</a> 
                  to make everyone able to decode the graph.<br>
                  The alternative that has been analysed for this kind of analysis was the Grouped Bar Chart with a group for each year. The positive aspects of the grouped bar chart is that it
                  makes easier the comparison between the three categories for each year but it makes too hard the identification of a trend.
                  The reason why it has been chosen the line chart is that it is more expressive to spot trends and  
                  it is the best way to answer to the specific question above.

                  As well as in the previous visualisations it has been used the python code for filtering data and build specific dataset for this visualisation. 
                  In particular the columns that differ from "ID", "category" and "launched" for the categories <i>3D Printing</i>, <i>Robots</i> , <i>Software</i> have been deleted.
                  Obviously, the same filter can be applied directly inside the Vega-Lite code, but it has been used the python code to make the page loading much faster.
                  The filters used inside the Vega-Lite code made possible the restriction over the years from 2014 to 2017.

                  The dataset used, from the two available on the Kaggle Repository, was the "ks-project-201801.csv" because, as the title 
                suggests and as well as data exploration comes up, it concerns data from 2009 to 2017. The other one available, instead, contains 
                data from 2009 to 2016. Furthermore, this choice has also been made due to the presence of the columns "usd pledged real" and 
                "usd goal real" which meaning is explained below. The dataset contains information and details about the Kickstarter Projects. 
                Being more specific, each line is referred to a particular project and for each one of them there are a lot of information about the project 
                referred. Following a brief explanation of the attributes used for the analysis:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <i>name</i> of the Project;</li>
                  <li>The <i>main category</i>  in which the project is collocated;</li>
                  <li>The <i>category</i> that represent a sub-category in the wider main category;</li>
                  <li>The <i>launched</i> that represents the date in which the project was launched;</li>
                  <li>The <i>state</i> that denotes if the project has been successful (i.e. the case in which the money 
                    pledged were higher than the goal), failed (i.e. the case in which the money pledged were lower than the goal), cancelled, live, suspended and undefined.</li>
                  <li>The <i>backers</i> which represents the number of people that support this project;</li>
                  <li>The <i>usd_pledged_real</i> which is, considering that not all the projects use the same currency, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column;</li>
                  <li>The <i>usd_goal_real</i> which is, as the usd_pledged_real, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column.</li>
                </ul>
                To avoid the slowness of page loading, as consequence of the weight of the whole dataset, it has been filtered using a Jupyter 
                Python Notebook to delete the rows and the columns that have not been used in the specific visualisation. 
                The data-sets of filtered data and the code used to obtain them have been uploaded on <a href = "https://github.com/antoniolch/KickstarterProjectDetails">this</a href> Github Repository.</br>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">This scatterplot shows, considering the main category Technology, the relationship between the <i>goal</i>, 
                measured in the USD currency, which represents the objective of a specific project and the <i>pledged</i>, 
                measured in the USD currency as well, which represents the money that have been sent by the people for supporting 
                that project. Only the successful and failed project are considered in this analysis. 
                Hovering over a point will reveal some information about that specific project like name, category, 
                goal and pledged. The colours used are blue to represent the successful projects and orange to represent the failed projects. </td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                The first aspect that comes up from this graph is that the projects with a high goal were failed, receiving just few moneys or nothing. 
                Furthermore, the projects that have success, generally have received much more money than the prefixed goal. 
                This is the reason why the points are distributed along the axis and not on the diagonal as it would have happened if the pledged money had been more or less equal than a target money. 
                Considering a generic project, this may suggest that either the project has lot of success or it fails miserably.
                There are also some interesting outliers highlighted with the orange triangle. They regard the most four successful projects 
                that have been rewarded with more than 4,000,000 dollars:
                <ol start="1">
                  <li>"Pono Music - Where Your Soul Rediscovers with" 6,225,354.98 dollars;</li>
                  <li>"Bring Reading Rainbow Back for Every Child, Everywhere!"" With 5408916.95 dollars;</li>
                  <li>"ZeTime: World's first smartwatch with hands over touchscreen" with 5333792.84 dollars;</li>
                  <li>"Pimax: The World's First 8K VR Headset" with 4236618.49 dollars.</li>
                </ol>
                The analysis of these four projects enforces the previous consideration where there are successful projects that have earned much more than the goal aimed.

                It has been used the scatterplot because it is the best way to show the relationship between two quantitative variables (i.e. the <i>pledged money</i> and the <i>goal money</i>). 
                The chosen colours have been blue for failed projects, and orange for successful projects according to the 
                <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/TableauColors/ColorPaletteswithRGBValues?%3Aembed=y&%3AshowVizHome=no&%3Adisplay_count=y&%3Adisplay_static_image=y">Colour Blind 10 palette</a>, 
                to make everyone able to decode the graph.<br> For this kind of analysis, the alternative considered was a binned heatmap that it is a very good way to show the data distribution avoiding the overlap of points. 
                However, as consequence of the fact that colours in the heatmap are used to encode density and it couldn't be used to distinguish the successful projects from the failed projects, 
                the scatterplot was preferred. Furthermore, using the scatterplot make you able to use the tooltip for seeing additional details as which of the new measure inserted "% of Goal Earned" 
                that represents the percentage of the pledges over the prefixed goal.

                The failed prejects, which goal was over 6,500,000 dollars, representing extreme outliers, have been cancelled using Vegal-Lite filters to avoid the graph to be too long along the x-axes and hard to read. 
                Using the python code for filtering data, only the following columns for the successful and failed projects have been maintained: "ID","name", "category", "state", "usd_pledged_real", 
                "usd_goal_real" to avoid slowdowns during loading as consequence of the original dataset weight. Furthermore, still using python code, only the data concerning the Technology Main 
                Category have been used as consequence of the specific question about that Category. Obviously, the same filter can be applied directly inside the Vega-Lite code, 
                but it has been used the python code to make the page loading much faster.

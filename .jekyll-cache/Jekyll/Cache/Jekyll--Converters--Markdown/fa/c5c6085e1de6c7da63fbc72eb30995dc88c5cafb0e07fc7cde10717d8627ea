<h1 id="the-project">The Project</h1>

<p>This project has been made during my study period abroad and concerning the rules of making a good visualisation. It is divided into three section, all of them regard a simple analysis that comes up whating a visualisation made over a Kickstart dataset.</p>

<p>More secifically, the dataset that could be taken <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects#ks-projects-201801.csv">here</a> contains information and details about the Kickstarter Projects  undertaken from 2009 to 2017. It is very detailed and constains information about  the money goal and those pledged, the dates of start and deadllines as well.</p>

<p>All the visualisations have been made using the <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">VegaLite</a> framework.</p>

<h1 id="dataset-description">Dataset Description</h1>
<p>The dataset used, from the two available on the Kaggle Repository, was the “ks-project-201801.csv” because, as the title 
suggests and as well as data exploration comes up, it concerns data from 2009 to 2017. The other one available, instead, contains 
data from 2009 to 2016. Furthermore, this choice has also been made due to the presence of the columns “usd real” and 
“usd goal real” which meaning is explained below. The dataset contains information and details about the KickProjects. 
Being more specific, each line is referred to a particular project and for each one of them there are ainformation about the project 
referred. Following a brief explanation of the attributes used for the analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>name</i> of the Project;</li>
  <li>The <i>main category</i>  in which the project is collocated;</li>
  <li>The <i>category</i> that represent a sub-category in the wider main category;</li>
  <li>The <i>launched</i> that represents the date in which the project was launched;</li>
  <li>The <i>state</i> that denotes if the project has been successful (i.e. the case in which the money 
    pledged were higher than the goal), failed (i.e. the case in which the money pledged were lower than the goal), cancelled, live, suspended and undefined.</li>
  <li>The <i>backers</i> which represents the number of people that support this project;</li>
  <li>The <i>usd_pledged_real</i> which is, considering that not all the projects use the same currency, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column;</li>
  <li>The <i>usd_goal_real</i> which is, as the usd_pledged_real, the conversion of the USD dollars of the pledged column.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid the slowness of page loading, as consequence of the weight of the whole dataset, it has been filterea Jupyter 
Python Notebook to delete the rows and the columns that have not been used in the specific visualisation. 
The data-sets of filtered data and the code used to obtain them have been uploaded on <a href="&quot;https://gitantoniolch/KickstarterProjectDetails&quot;">this</a> Github Repository.</p>

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p><strong><em>Considering the successful projects, which is the <i>Main Category</i> with the greatest number of them? Did it also have the greatest number of <i>Backers</i> and of <i>Money Pledged</i>?</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Considering the only Successful projects, these three bar charts show respectively, for each <i>Main Category</i>, the number of projects, the number of backers and the total amount of money pledged in the USD currency. Each row represents the nominal attribute <i>Main Category</i> and its length represents the related quantitative attribute (i.e. the Number of Successful project for the bar chart on the left, the Number of Backers for the bar chart on the center and the Money Pledged in USD currency for the bar chart on the right). Each bar chart is also sorted in relation to its own quantitative attribute. Hovering over a bar will also reveal the exact value of the quantitative attribute for the specific category.</p>

<h3 id="insight">Insight</h3>
<p>Against the expectation involving the “Technology” category as a winner, due to the nature of Kickstarter as an online platform, the category with the highest number successful projects is Music. This may means that, although Kickstarter is an online platform (i.e. strongly related to the technology field) where people try to finance their projects, other different kind of projects have been more appreciated. However, analyzing the number of supporters, music is not in first place. From the combination of this result with the result shown by the Money Pledged (USD) bar chart, where music is in 5th place, it can be assumed that music is a field in which projects generally have a lower goal then the other categories projects.(i.e. they do nots need a huge amount of money to be successful).</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h3>
<p>The horizontal bar charts have been chosen because it is a very effective way for length comparing. This makes very easy the comparisons between categories.
Adding a bit of redundancy and according to the Colour Pre-Attentive Property, in particular with the fact that differences in hue are perceived in the pre-attention phase, 
it has been chosen the red colour for the <i>Main Category</i> with the greatest number of successful projects. 
The Chart starts at 0, as all bar charts should be, for better understanding the difference between bars and avoiding misunderstandings.
The alternative considered has been a <i>Grouped Bar Chart</i> with a group for each Main Category. The positive aspect of this alternative is the compactness of the visualisation in which all the information could be encoded in the same chart. Nevertheless, the visualisation could be very difficult to decode because of the differences in the scale range of the quantitative attributes. 
This last problem could be overcome using normalisation. Also in this case the visualization remains difficult to decode and in particular it is difficult to make comparisons between the categories.
Horizontal bar charts have also been considered, but they were been discarded to avoid the use of angled texts that are hard to read.</p>

<h3 id="data-filtering-and-transformation">Data filtering and transformation</h3>
<p>The dataset for this visualisation was filtered before using the python code uploaded on the Github repository. More precisely, only the columns “ID”, “Main Category”, “Backers” and “USD Pledged Real” of the successful projects are present in this filtered data version because they are the only used. Obviously, the same filter can be applied directly inside the Vega-Lite code, but it has been used the python code to make the page loading much faster.</p>

<h1 id="visualisation-2">Visualisation 2</h1>

<h2 id="question-1">Question</h2>
<p><em>** Regarding the <i>Robot</i>, <i>3D Printing</i> and <i>Software</i> categories, how the number of projects launched vary across the years from 2014 to 2017? Is the pattern consistent between these three categories? **</em></p>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>This line chart aims to show how the number of projects launched in the main category 
                  <i>Technology</i> vary during the period from 2014 to 2017, considering the <i>Robot</i>, <i>3D Printing</i> and <i>Software</i> sub-category. 
                  The tooltip is not used here because useless in this context.</p>

<h3 id="insight-1">Insight</h3>
<p>Using this line chart, it is possible to see the trend during the years from 2014 to 2017 regarding respectively the <i>3D Printing</i>, 
                  the <i>Robots</i> and the <i>Software</i> categories. This graph shows that there was a great increase in the number of projects launched in the 2015 in each category. 
                  However, <i>Software</i> category has had a greater interesting then the other two, considering the number of projects launched in the whole period. 
                  Then, the pattern that comes up from this analysis is the general increase in the number of projects launched during 2015 followed by a slight decrease during the following years.</p>
<h3 id="design-considerations-1">Design considerations</h3>
<p>It has been used a line chart because it is the best way to spot and compare trends as which seen before. 
                  Colours have been also used to encode the different analysed categories. The colours choice is made according to the 
                  <a href="&quot;https://public.tableau.com/views/TableauColors/ColorPaletteswithRGBValues?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no&amp;%3Adisplay_count=y&amp;%3Adisplay_static_image=y&quot;">Colour Blind 10 palette to make everyone able to decode the graph</a>.
                  The alternative that has been analysed for this kind of analysis was the Grouped Bar Chart with a group for each year. The positive aspects of the grouped bar chart is that it
                  makes easier the comparison between the three categories for each year but it makes too hard the identification of a trend.
                  The reason why it has been chosen the line chart is that it is more expressive to spot trends and<br />
                  it is the best way to answer to the specific question above.</p>
